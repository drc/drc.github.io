Hey, I'm Dan Cigrang!

![Dan Cigrang](./dan_100.webp)

I'm a web developer from Chicago, IL. I've worked on the ServiceNow platform professionally for the past 10 years at [Discover](https://discover.com). While my background is in web development, most of my current work is within enterprise infrastructure tools. 

I use JavaScript most of my day working on the platform and on my web-based hobby projects. Lately I've been working a lot using shell scripting and Python. This always changes because I love learning new tech!

**I love to learn stuff.** Partially why I created this site! Not only did I create a blog to write about what I'm learning, the process of getting this [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) site up and built on GitHub Pages was a learning opportunity; I can't pass that up!

Other than tech, I've been into gardening the past few years, and learned how to grow hops in my backyard for homebrewing. I love cooking and trying new recipes that push my skills farther than using a microwave. This gives me an opportunity to improve my knife skills! I have an English Bulldog that hangs out with my in my office while I work. I love getting to play with him when he's awake...
